AWS - CLI

using AWC-CLI on local computer, EC2 machines
using AWC-SDK on local computer, EC2 machines
using AWS Instance metadata service for EC2

install AWS CLI
aws --version

IAM User - Users

aws configure
put key access key and secret key

it create files ~ / .aws

AWS CLI on EC2
IAM roles can be attached to apps like EC2 instances which comes with a policy
*** what EC2 should be able to do and EC2 instances can then use these policies without additional configurations

IAM - Role
Select EC2 as trust service
create policy
AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
myEC2RoleForS3

Select EC2
Instance Settings -- Attach IAM Roles

***  aws s3 ls s3://mys3bucket1

aws s3 mb s3://mys3bucket2 will be error as we only provides read only access to IAM role assign to EC2

** Apply S3 policy may take some times as it replicates
** A role can be assigned to multiple EC2 instances
** But each EC2 instance can have only one role

aws s3 cp help

We can also leverage AWS Policy Simulator to test the policy
https://policysim.aws.amazon.com

AWS EC2 instance Metadata
it allows AWS EC2 instances to learn about themselves
you can retrieve IAM role name from metadata but CANNOT retrieve IAM policy

URL is http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance_id 
will get my instance id of the EC2 instance

curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/myRoleName

it comes for free
metadata = info about EC2 instance
userdata = launch script of the  EC2 instance

AWS SDK
perform action on AWS via your applications without CLI
Official SDK are Java,.NEt,Nodejs,PHP,Python (boto3/botocore), Go,Rubby,C++

AWS CLI uses Python SKD (boto3)
us-east-1 will be chosen by default

SDK Security Credentials
recommended to use default credential provider chain
like ~/.qss/credentials , IAM Roles (work wint) or Environment variables (not recommended)

Exponential Back off
API that fails because of too many calls needs to be retired with Exponential
fist 20ms the 40ms and so on
Retry mechanism

** You can't attach EC2 IAM roles to on premise servers
