- Situations where you do not want to change application URLs

SQS
Visibility timeout
Other consumers will not receive a message being processed for the configured time period
default - 30 seconds, min - 0, max - 12 hours

DelaySeconds
The time period before a new message is visible on the queue

Message retention period
The maximum period a message can be on the queue
Default - 4 days, Min - 60 seconds, Max - 14 days

To restrict access to S3 buckets only from cloudfront, create a special user OAI and associate
with CloudFront Distribution, configure S3 bucket policy to allow access only to OAI

If the application does not delete the message from the queue, after the visibility timeout, the message will be available in the queue again.

DynamoDB Streams help you to trigger real-time events from changes to DynamoDB tables (in time-sequenced order)

The maximum allowed time for lambda execution is 900 seconds (15 mins  max)(default - 3 seconds).

De-registration delay ensures that the Load Balancer gives in-flight requests a chance to complete execution.
It can be 0 to 3600 seconds (default 300 seconds or 5 mins). Also called Connection Draining.

Keep the servers that need to be secured in a private subnet so that they are not directly accessible from the internet.
Keep the NAT Gateway in the public subnet and allow the servers in the private subnet to connect to the internet (to download software patches).
This is the more secure setup.
Important to Note: NAT Gateway has to be set up in the public subnet

Use Intelligent-Tiering for Long-lived data with changing or unknown access patterns
Lambda@Edge can help you block unwanted bots at the edge, and let the authorized traffic go through.

Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
Ideal for High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications like weather modeling
EFA = ENA + OS-bypass

You want the application to connect to the database instance using IAM based authentication using an authentication token? 
IAM database Authentication enables you to achieve

Amazon DynamoDB
Fast, scalable, distributed for any scale (Automatically partitions data as it grows)
Single-digit millisecond responses for millions of transactions per second
Maintains 3 replicas within the same region

Multi-AZ deployments provide high availability (failover)
Read Replicas provide high scalability (load)

VPC Flow Logs helps you to monitor network traffic and troubleshoot connectivity issues (NACL and/or Security Groups misconfiguration).  
You can capture traffic going in and out of your VPC (network interfaces).
VPC Flow Logs can be created for:
VPC
a subnet
a network interface (connecting to ELB, RDS, ElastiCache, Redshift, etc)

VPC Flow Logs can publish logs to Amazon CloudWatch Logs or Amazon S3.

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is an in-memory caching solution for DynamoDB providing microsecond response times.
DAX can reduce your costs by saving DynamoDB read capacity units.

Installing OS patches and software using user data at the launch of EC2 instances increases boot-up time. 
Prefer using a Customized AMI with OS patches and software pre-installed.

AWS CloudTrail tracks events, API calls, changes made to your AWS resources:
Who made the request? - What action was performed? - What are the parameters used? - What was the result?

Amazon RDS Proxy efficiently manages database connections. It sits between client applications (including lambdas) and RDS.

Amazon CloudFront integrates with
- AWS Shield to protect from DDoS attacks
- AWS Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect from SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting, etc

Serve users from nearest edge location (based on user location)
Source content can be from S3, EC2, ELB, and External Websites

Creating a Static Website using Amazon S3 helps in reducing the load on EC2 instances but it does NOT help with improving latency.

Geoproximity - Choose the nearest resource (geographic distance) to your user.

Geolocation	- Configure the target based on the continent, country or state (within the United States) of the user
choose based on user location
ie if user is from US, the request will go the EC2 in US region via Route53

Amazon Athena can be used to run direct ad-hoc SQL querying data stored in S3.
An Ad-Hoc Query is a query that cannot be determined prior to the moment the query is issued

Amazon Redshift Spectrum can run queries directly against S3 without loading complete data from S3 into a data warehouse. 
Amazon Redshift Spectrum is recommended if you are executing queries frequently against un-structured data.
Amazon Redshift Spectrum helps you run SQL queries against datasets in Amazon S3. It does need any intermediate data stores.
This eliminates expensive data transfers from S3 to data warehousing solutions.

Redshift Spectrum is not an option without Redshift

Standard Queue
Unlimited throughput
BUT NO guarantee of ordering (Best-Effort Ordering)
and NO guarantee of exactly-once processing (some messages can be processed twice)

FIFO (first-in-first-out) Queue
First-In-First-out Delivery
Exactly-Once Processing
BUT throughput is  a lot lower  

Amazon S3 Object Lock prevents the deletion of objects and allows you to meet regulatory requirements.
It can be enabled only on new buckets. 
It automatically enables versioning. 

RDS
Multi-AZ creates a standby and improves availability.
Creating Read Replicas does not help with availability but increase scalability
Migrating the Database to Aurora Serverless is NOT the simplest solution.

S3 Consistency Model

READ AFTER WRITE for new objects
Eventual Consistency for Overwrite PUTS and DELETES

S3 Data is highly distributed across multiple AZs and (possibly) multiple regions:
When you create a new object, it is immediately available
You might get a previous version of data immediately after an object update using PUT/DELETE
You will never get partial or inconsistent data

Amazon FSx for Lustre is optimized for performance
For high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, and media processing use cases

- Security Groups are default deny , If there are no rules configured, no outbound/inbound traffic is allowed
- You can specify allow rules ONLY
- You can configure separate rules for inbound and outbound traffic
- You can assign multiple (up to five) Security Groups to your EC2 instances

EC2 System-level metrics (CPU, Disk, Network) are automatically tracked by Amazon 
Amazon CloudWatch does NOT have access to operating system metrics like memory 

Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose is ideal for Data ingestion for streaming data. 
You can store streaming data to S3, Elasticsearch, Redshift, and Splunk.

Creating an IAM role in the PROD AWS Account and adding DEV AWS Account as a trusted account is the recommended approach. 

Cold HDD 								  - Infrequent access use cases (minimum cost)
Throughput Optimized HDD  - Frequently accessed, large sequential operations with high throughput (cost-sensitive)
General Purpose SSD 		  - System boot volumes and transactional workloads
Provisioned IOPS SSD 		  - Transactional workloads needing very high IOPS (up to 64,000 IOPS per volume)

Redshift Workload Management
WLM can be configured to PRIORITIZE QUEUES
Create multiple queues with different concurrency level for different purposes
One queue for long-running queries with low concurrency
One queue for short running queries with high concurrency (up to 50 concurrent queries)

based on content type
You can use S3 Lifecycle Configuration to perform transition actions (one storage class to another) and expiration actions (delete objects)

Create a Virtual Private Gateway on the AWS side of the VPN and a Customer Gateway on the on-premises side of the VPN
Amazon VPC provides the facility to create an IPsec VPN connection (also known as site-to-site VPN) between remote customer networks and their Amazon VPC over the internet. 

Virtual private gateway: A Virtual Private Gateway (also known as a VPN Gateway) is the endpoint on the AWS VPC side of your VPN connection.
VPN connection: A secure connection between your on-premises equipment and your VPCs.
VPN tunnel: An encrypted link where data can pass from the customer network to or from AWS.
Customer Gateway: An AWS resource that provides information to AWS about your Customer Gateway device.
Customer Gateway device: A physical device or software application on the customer side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection.

Using AWS Glue involves significant development efforts to write custom migration scripts to copy the database data into Redshift.
Using EMR involves significant infrastructure management efforts to set up and maintain the EMR cluster. Additionally this option involves a major development effort to write custom migration jobs to copy the database data into Redshift.
, you should use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that run on an EC2 instance. When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a username and password or access keys) to an EC2 instance. 
The role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other

Type of AC		Account Level control   User level control

IAM policies 				No									Yes
ACL							Yes									No
Bucket Policies			Yes									Yes	


IAM policies are attached to the users, enabling centralized control of permissions for users under your AWS Account to access buckets or objects. 
With IAM policies, you can only grant users within your own AWS account permission to access your Amazon S3 resources

With ACLs, you can only grant other AWS accounts (not specific users) access to your Amazon S3 resources


Dedicated Hosts enable you to use your existing server-bound software licenses like Windows Server and address corporate compliance and regulatory requirements.
Dedicated instances may share hardware with other instances from the same AWS account that are not dedicated instances. 
Dedicated instances cannot be used for existing server-bound software licenses
Neither on-demand instances nor reserved instances can be used for existing server-bound software licenses.

Amazon Aurora Global Database is designed for globally distributed applications, allowing a single Amazon Aurora database to span multiple AWS regions. 
It replicates your data with no impact on database performance, enables fast local reads with low latency in each region, and provides disaster recovery from region-wide outage

AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. 
The service provides three different types of gateways – Tape Gateway, File Gateway, and Volume Gateway 

- Amazon EFS is a file storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file system access 
These are different storage systems and EFS is not backed by S3

*** The Auto Scaling group ASG is using EC2 based health check and the Application Load Balancer  is using its in-built health check
If both the Auto Scaling group and Application Load Balancer use ALB based health checks, then you will be able to avoid the scenario mentioned in the question.
ALB cannot use EC2 based health 

That makes heterogeneous migrations a two-step process. 
First use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool to convert the source schema and code to match that of the target database, 
and then use the AWS Database Migration Service to migrate data from the source database to the target database

just remember that the original Snowball device had 80TB of storage space.
Basic Schema Copy is great for doing a test migration, or when you are migrating databases heterogeneously e.g. Oracle to MySQL or SQL Server to Oracle. 
Basic Schema Copy will not migrate secondary indexes, foreign keys or stored procedures. 

ALB uses  routing based on the content of the request

Classic Load Balancer is intended for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.
Network Load Balancer or Classic Load Balancer cannot be used to route traffic based on the content of the request

NAT instance can be used as bastion server but not NAT GW
NAT instance supports port forwarding  but not NAT GW
SG can be associated with NAT instance  but not NAT GW

Amazon RDS uses several different technologies to provide failover support. Multi-AZ deployments for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances use Amazon's failover technology. 
SQL Server DB instances use SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups (AGs)
Multi-AZ means the URL is the same, the failover is automated, and the CNAME will automatically be updated to point to the standby database.

The CloudWatch recovery option works only for system check failures, not for instance status check failures. Also, if you terminate your instance, then it can't be recovered.

You can create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors an Amazon EC2 instance and automatically recovers the instance if it becomes impaired due to an underlying hardware failure or a problem that requires AWS involvement to repair. 
Terminated instances cannot be recovered. A recovered instance is identical to the original instance
The recover action is supported only on instances that have EBS volumes configured on them, 
instance store volumes are not supported for automatic recovery by CloudWatch alarms.

Kinesis will be great for event streaming from the IoT devices,
SNS is a notification service and will be perfect for this use case.
Kinesis is better for streaming data since queues aren't meant for real-time streaming of data.

Amazon Kinesis with Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) 
It is an email service and not a notification service as is the requirement in the current use case.

Snowball Edge Storage Optimized is the optimal choice if you need to securely and quickly transfer dozens of terabytes to petabytes of data to AWS. It provides up to 80 TB of usable HDD storage
You can't directly copy data from Snowball Edge devices into AWS Glacier.

Direct Connect involves significant monetary investment and takes more than a month to set up
Site to Site VPN Connections are a good solution if you have an immediate need, and have low to modest bandwidth requirement

Application Load Balancer can be used to securely authenticate users for accessing your applications. This enables you to offload the work of authenticating users to your load balancer
You cannot use Cognito Identity Pools for managing user authentication

By default, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second with batching, or up to 300 messages per second (300 send, receive, or delete operations per second) without batching
The name of a FIFO queue must end with the .fifo suffix. 
You can't convert an existing standard queue into a FIFO queue. To make the move, you must either create a new FIFO queue for your application or delete your existing standard queue and recreate it as a FIFO queue.

A permissions boundary can be used to control the maximum permissions employees can grant to the IAM principals (that is, users and roles) that they create and manage
As a best practice, the root user should not access the AWS account to carry out any administrative procedures.

The EC2 instances that are part of the ASG are the ones accessing the database layer. The correct response is to add a rule to the security group attached to Aurora authorizing the EC2 instance's security group.

AWS Security Hub gives you a comprehensive view of your high-priority security alerts and security posture across your AWS accounts
AWS Firewall Manager is a security management service that allows you to CENTRALLY CONFIGURE and manage firewall rules across your accounts and applications in AWS Organization. 

In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.

Both AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration use AWS edge locations to improve network performance connecting to AWS

Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of larger objects.

AWS Global Accelerator is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. 
It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers or Amazon EC2 instances. 

As mentioned earlier, the minimum storage duration is 30 days before you can transition objects from S3 Standard to S3 One Zone-IA or S3 Standard-IA,
S3 One Zone-IA is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs), 
S3 One Zone-IA stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard-IA. 
S3 One Zone-IA is ideal for customers who want a lower-cost option for infrequently accessed and re-creatable 

The core of Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Neptune powers graph use cases such as recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network security.

Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data directly in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless,

A launch template is similar to a launch configuration, in that it specifies instance configuration information such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair, security groups, and the other parameters that you use to launch EC2 instances. 
Also, defining a launch template instead of a launch configuration allows you to have multiple versions of a template.

A launch configuration is an instance configuration template that an Auto Scaling group uses to launch EC2 instance
You cannot use a launch configuration to provision capacity across multiple instance types using both On-Demand Instances and Spot Instances

If you have multiple AWS Site-to-Site VPN connections, you can provide secure communication between sites using the AWS VPN CloudHub. 
This enables your remote sites to communicate with each other, and not just with the VPC

A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and 
A VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. 

The AWS Transit Gateway allows customers to connect their Amazon VPCs and their on-premises networks to a single gateway. 
With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create and manage a single connection from the central gateway into each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center, or remote office across your network. 
AWS Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks, which act like spokes

The Transit VPC can be used to enable connectivity between various VPC’s in different regions and customer data centers. 
You can use this to connect multiple VPCs that are geographically disparate and/or running in separate AWS accounts, to a common VPC that serves as a global network transit center

User data of an instance can be used to perform common automated configuration tasks or run scripts after the instance starts. User data, cannot, however, be used to install the application.

To analyse any API calls made within an AWS account, CloudTrail is used.
Cognito is the best technology choice for managing mobile user accounts.
IAM cannot be used to manage mobile user accounts.

The Amazon VPC console wizard provides the following four configurations: 

1)VPC with a single public subnet 
We recommend this configuration if you need to run a single-tier, public-facing web application

2) VPC with public and private subnets (NAT)
We recommend this scenario if you want to run a public-facing web application while maintaining back-end servers that aren't publicly accessible. 

3)VPC with a private subnet only and AWS Site-to-Site VPN access
We recommend this scenario if you want to extend your network into the cloud and also directly access the Internet from your VPC. 
This scenario enables you to run a multi-tiered application with a scalable web front end in a public subnet and to house your data in a private subnet that is connected to your network by an IPsec AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection.

Question 33

----------------------------
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams enables real-time processing of streaming big data.
It provides ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or replay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kinesis Applications. 
when you want both applications to consume data from the same stream concurrently and independently.

SNS is a notification service and cannot be used for real-time processing of data.

Use VPC sharing to share one or more subnets with other AWS accounts belonging to the same parent organization from AWS Organizations

VPC sharing (part of Resource Access Manager) allows multiple AWS accounts to create their application resources such as EC2 instances, RDS databases, Redshift clusters, and Lambda functions, into shared and centrally-managed Amazon Virtual Private Clouds 
VPC peering does not facilitate centrally managed VPCs. 
an AWS owner account cannot share the VPC itself with another AWS account

Amazon FSx for Lustre makes it easy and cost-effective to launch and run the world’s most popular high-performance file system. It is used for workloads such as machine learning, high-performance computing (HPC), video processing, and financial modeling
FSx for Lustre provides the ability to both process the 'hot data' in a parallel and distributed fashion as well as easily store the 'cold data' on Amazon S3

FSx for Windows does not allow you to present S3 objects as files and does not allow you to write changed data back to S3
EMR does not offer the same storage and processing speed as FSx for Lustre.
AWS Glue job is meant to be used for batch ETL data processing

By default, scripts entered as user data are executed with root user privileges 
By default, user data runs only during the boot cycle when you first launch an instance
You can update your configuration to ensure that your user data scripts and cloud-init directives run every time you restart your instance.
- You can't change the user data if the instance is running (even by using root user credentials), but you can view it.

Dedicated Instances - Dedicated Instances are Amazon EC2 instances that run in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware that's dedicated to a single customer

A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) mode
Traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance
f you specify targets using an instance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primary private IP address specified in the primary network interface for the instance. The load balancer rewrites the destination IP address from the data packet before forwarding it to the target instance.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive offers the lowest cost storage in the cloud
S3 Glacier Deep Archive is up to 75% less expensive than S3 Glacier and provides retrieval within 12 hours

You can use CloudWatch Alarms to send an email via SNS whenever any of the EC2 instances breaches a certain threshold
You cannot use AWS Lambda to monitor CPU utilization of EC2 instances or send notification emails
EC2 Reboot CloudWatch Alarm action can be used to reboot the instance in case of Instance health check failure
Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your EC2 instances. 

Use AWS WAF to block or allow requests based on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses
With geo match conditions you can choose the countries from which AWS WAF should allow access.

To prevent your API from being overwhelmed by too many requests, Amazon API Gateway throttles requests to your API using the token bucket algorithm, where a token counts for a request
SQS offers buffer capabilities to smooth out temporary volume spikes without losing messages or increasing latency
Kinesis can buffer incoming data
AWS Lambda cannot be used for buffering. 

With Amazon API Gateway, you can run a fully managed REST API that integrates with Lambda to execute your business logic and includes traffic management, 
authorization and access control, monitoring, and API versioning.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
S3 Standard-IA which provides immediate access and 99.9% availability.
The S3 One Zone-IA tier provides immediate access, but the availability is lower at 99.5%
The Glacier storage class does not provide immediate access. You can retrieve within hours or minutes, but you do need to submit a job to retrieve the data.

To apply the restrictions across multiple member accounts you must use a Service Control Policy (SCP) in the AWS Organization. The way you would do this is to create a deny rule that applies to anything that does not equal the specific instance type you want to allow
With IAM you need to apply the policy within each account rather than centrally
AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any AWS account or within your AWS Organization. It is not used for restricting access or permissions

Amazon SNS is a notification service so it delivers notifications to subscribers.
In this case we need to find a durable and loosely coupled solution for storing jobs. Amazon SQS is ideal for this use case and can be configured to use dynamic scaling based on the number of jobs waiting in the queue

Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL. Athena is serverless, and used to minimize infrastructure costs for infrequent queries.
Amazon RedShift Spectrum is a feature of Amazon Redshift that enables you to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3, with no loading or ETL required. 
However, RedShift nodes run on EC2 instances, so for infrequent queries this will not minimize infrastructure costs.

Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed, highly reliable file storage that is accessible over the industry-standard Server Message Block (SMB) protocol
Amazon FSx is built on Windows Server
Amazon FSX for Windows File Server supports Distributed File System Replication (DFSR)

AWS Storage Gateway is primarily used for connecting on-premises storage to cloud storage.

You cannot copy EBS volumes directly from EBS to Amazon S3.
You cannot create an EBS volume directly from Amazon S3.

S3 Glacier is not a suitable storage location for live access to data, it is used for archival

Amazon EFS only supports Linux systems
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources
EFS is a great choice as it will provide a scalable file system that can be mounted by multiple EC2 instances and accessed simultaneously.

Storing the file in an S3 bucket is the most cost-efficient solution, and using S3 event notifications to invoke a Lambda function works well for this unpredictable workload.
Kinesis data streams runs on EC2 instances and you must therefore provision some capacity even when the application is not receiving files. This is not as cost-efficient 
SQS queues have a maximum message size of 256KB. You can use the extended client library for Java to use pointers to a payload on S3 but the maximum payload size is 2GB.

Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources that serve your traffic based on the geographic location of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries originate from.

(Spot blocks) Spot Instances with a defined duration  are designed not to be interrupted and will run continuously for the duration you select. 
This makes them ideal for jobs that take a finite time to complete, such as batch processing, encoding and rendering, modeling and analysis, and continuous integration.

Reserved instances are good for continuously running workloads that run for a period of 1 or 3 years.
These reserved instances are ideal for workloads that run for a certain number of hours each day, but not for just 5 days per quarter.

Security groups cannot block traffic by country.

When a user requests your content, CloudFront typically serves the requested content regardless of where the user is located
This is the easiest and most effective way to implement a geographic restriction for the delivery of content.

Configure an Application Load Balancer in front of an Auto Scaling group to deploy instances to multiple Availability Zones
* You cannot launch instances in multiple Regions from a single Auto Scaling group.
API gateway is not used for load balancing connections to Amazon EC2 instances.
.
Amazon MQ is similar to SQS but is used for existing applications that are being migrated into AWS. 
SQS should be used for new applications being created in the cloud.
You can use a Lambda function to process Amazon Simple Notification Service notifications. Amazon SNS supports Lambda functions as a target for messages sent to a topic.

An Elastic Fabric Adapter is an AWS Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) with added capabilities.
It is ideal for tightly coupled app as it uses the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

The ENA, which provides Enhanced Networking, provides high bandwidth and low inter-instance latency but it does not support the features for a tightly-coupled app that the EFA does.

Amazon Aurora Global Database provides read access to a database in multiple regions 

Amazon DynamoDB global tables provide a fully managed solution for deploying a multi-region, multi-master database. 
This is the only solution presented that provides an active-active configuration where reads and writes can take place in multiple regions with full bi-directional synchronization

AWS Global Accelerator uses the vast, congestion-free AWS global network to route TCP and UDP traffic to a healthy application endpoint in the closest AWS Region to the user.
This means it will intelligently route traffic to the closest point of presence (reducing latency). Seamless failover is ensured as AWS Global Accelerator uses anycast IP address
AWS Global Accelerator endpoint is used for directing users to different instances of the application in different regions based on latency.


A Route 53 failover routing policy uses a primary and standby configuration. Therefore, it sends all traffic to the primary until it fails a health check at which time it sends traffic to the secondary.
Amazon CloudFront cannot be configured with “a pair of static IP addresses

S3 standard is the best choice in this scenario for a short term storage solution
there are no retrieval fees or minimum capacity charge 
Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering" is incorrect as there is an additional fee for using this service and for a short-term requirement it may not be beneficial

To specify permissions for a specific task on Amazon ECS you should use IAM Roles for Tasks. The permissions policy can be applied to tasks when creating the task definition, or by using an IAM task role override using the AWS CLI or SDKs. 
The taskRoleArn parameter is used to specify the policy.
You should not apply the permissions to the container instance as they will then apply to all tasks running on the instance as well as the instance itself.
The AmazonECSTaskExecutionRolePolicy policy is the Task Execution IAM Role. This is used by the container agent to be able to pull container images, write log file etc.

The AWS Storage Gateway Tape Gateway enables you to replace using physical tapes on premises with virtual tapes in AWS using iSCSI-virtual tape library (VTL) without changing existing backup workflow.

You must create a new master DB by taking a snapshot of the existing DB, encrypting the snapshot, and then creating the new DB from the snapshot. You can then create the encrypted cross-region Read Replica of the master DB. 

Use an AWS Storage Gateway file gateway to replace the NFS storage
Use an AWS Storage Gateway volume gateway to replace the Block storage

The S3 Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier, without performance impact or operational overhead.
It works by storing objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. 
This is an ideal use case for intelligent-tiering as the access patterns for the log files are not known.

Cognito User pools are used for User Authentication (provides openId connect and OAuth standard) Using IDP Facebook/Google 

Cognito Identity pools are used for User Authorization (Free) Provides AWS credentials for accessing resources on user behalf
Amazon Cognito identity pools provide temporary AWS credentials for users who are guests (unauthenticated) 
and for users who have been authenticated and received a token. An identity pool is a store of user identity data specific to your account.

Glacier objects can't be transitioned to other S3 storage classes

S3 is cheaper than EBS and EFS
EBS and EFF has higher performance than S3

DataSync is an ONLINE Data Transfer services copying large data to and from AWS over the internet or AWS Direct Connect
Uses an Agent (VM)

StorageGW is Hybrid cloud storage service that gives you on premise access to cloud storage by linking it to S3
Uses an Storage gateway appliance (VM)

More resilient to sporadic increase in request raes
CloudFront distribution in front of ALB
Aurora Replicas

Low latency and fast regional failover
Multiple regions behind ALB and use AWS Global Accelerator

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can passthrough encrypted traffic with an NLB and terminate the SSL on the EC2 instances,

Recreate the API using API Gateway which will allow the customer to only pay for what they use. 
AWS Lambda can likewise be used for the back-end processing reducing cost by utilizing a pay for what you use serverless service.

You can use an OAI to restrict access to content in Amazon S3 but not on EC2 or ELB.

The most resilient solution is to configure DX connections at multiple DX locations. This ensures that any issues impacting a single DX location do not affect availability of the network connectivity to AWS.
Creating your read replica as a Multi-AZ DB instance is independent of whether the source database is a Multi-AZ DB instance.

To publish messages to Amazon SNS topics from an Amazon VPC, create an interface VPC endpoint. (AWS PrivateLink)
Then, you can publish messages to SNS topics while keeping the traffic within the network that you manage with the VPC. 
This is the most secure option as traffic does not need to traverse the Internet.

Internet Gateways are used by instances in public subnets to access the Internet and this is less secure than an VPC endpoint.
A proxy instance will also use the public Internet and so is less secure than a VPC endpoint
A NAT Gateway is used by instances in private subnets to access the Internet and this is less secure than an VPC endpoint.

If you do not want to manage EC2 instances you must use the AWS Fargate launch type which is a serverless infrastructure managed by AWS. 
Fargate only supports container images hosted on Elastic Container Registry (ECR) or Docker Hub.

The EC2 Launch Type allows you to run containers on EC2 instances that you manage.

Amazon CloudFront can be used to stream video to users across the globe using a wide variety of protocols that are layered on top of HTTP. This can include both on-demand video as well as real time streaming video.
"AWS Global Accelerator" is an expensive way of getting the content closer to users compared to using CloudFront

EFS is not a block device, it is a filesystem that is accessed using the NFS protocol.
S3 is an object-based storage system, not a block-based storage system.
The Elastic Block Store (EBS) is a block storage device

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. 
Instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently, such as buffers, caches, scratch data, and other temporary content, or for data that is replicated across a 
fleet of instances, such as a load-balanced pool of web servers.

RedShift is a columnar data warehouse DB that is ideal for running long complex queries. 
RedShift can also improve performance for repeat queries by caching the result and returning the cached result when queries are re-run. 
Dashboard, visualization, and business intelligence (BI) tools that execute repeat queries see a significant boost in performance due to result caching.

The CloudFormation:TemplateURL, lets you specify where the CloudFormation template for a stack action, such as create or update, resides and enforce that it be used.
The CloudFormation API accepts a ResourceTypes parameter. In your API call, you specify which types of resources can be created or updated

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In a case where multiple consumer applications have total reads exceeding the per-shard limits, you need to increase the number of shards in the Kinesis data stream.
You cannot increase the number of read transactions per shard. Read throttling is enabled by default for Kinesis data streams

Amazon RedShift uses columnar storage and  is cost-effective to efficiently analyse all your data using your existing business intelligence tools

With target tracking scaling policies, you select a scaling metric and set a target value.
Instance stores offer very high performance and low latency and is cheaper than  EBS Provisioned IOPS.
Amazon EC2 Enhanced Networking with an EBS HDD Throughput Optimized volume provides higher bandwidth and lower latency and is implemented using an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA)

CloudTrail is used for monitoring API activity on your account, not for monitoring application logs.
CloudWatch Events delivers a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources.
CloudWatch Metrics represents a time-ordered set of data points that are published to CloudWatch.
CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold you specify

Uploading using a pre-signed URL allows you to upload the object without having any AWS security credentials/permissions. 
Pre-signed URLs can be generated programmatically and anyone who receives a valid pre-signed URL can then programmatically upload an object.
This solution bypasses the web server avoiding any performance bottlenecks.

CloudFront cannot expose static public IP addresses


AWS Global Accelerator is a service in which you create accelerators to improve availability and performance of your applications for local and global users. 
Global Accelerator directs traffic to optimal endpoints over the AWS global network. 
This improves the availability and performance of your internet applications that are used by a global audience. 
Global Accelerator is a global service that supports endpoints in multiple AWS Regions,
By default, Global Accelerator provides you with two static IP addresses that you associate with your accelerator

You can use Route 53 to check the health of your resources and only return healthy resources in response to DNS queries

A VPG is used to setup an AWS VPN which you can use in combination with Direct Connect to encrypt all data that traverses the Direct Connect link.
There is no option to enable IPSec encryption on the Direct Connect connection.
The  Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) protocol is not used to enable encryption for Direct Connect, it is used for routing.
An AWS Direct Connect Gateway is used to connect to VPCs across multiple AWS regions. It is not involved with encryption.

Scheduled scaling allows you to set your own scaling schedule. In this case the scaling action can be scheduled to occur just prior to the time that the reports will be run each month.
ElastiCache is a database cache, it cannot replace the compute functions of an EC2 instance.

Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is not an ideal storage solution for a database.
General Purpose SSD is more expensive  than Throughput Optimized HDD
Throughput Optimized HDD is the most cost-effective storage option and for a small DB with low traffic volumes it may be sufficient. Note that the volume must be at least 500 GB in size.


An Aurora Replica is both a standby in a Multi-AZ configuration and a target for read traffic. 

You can use the CloudWatch agent to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. The agent supports both Windows Server and Linux, and enables you to select the metrics to be collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core.
CloudWatch agent  capture SwapUtilization metrics and send them to CloudWatch. This is the best way to get memory utilization metrics from Amazon EC2 instnaces

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Launch Configurations are used with Auto Scaling Groups.
Launch templates enable you to store launch parameters so that you do not have to specify them every time you launch an instance. 
When you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, an AWS SDK, or a command line tool, you can specify the launch template to use.


Multi-AZ is used for implementing fault tolerance. With Multi-AZ you can failover to a DB in another AZ within the region in the event of a failure of the primary DB.
 However, you can only read and write to the primary DB so still need a read replica to offload the reporting job

Redis authentication tokens enable Redis to require a token (password) before allowing clients to execute commands, thereby improving data security.

You can require that users enter a token on a token-protected Redis server. To do this, include the parameter --auth-token (API: AuthToken) with the correct token when you create your replication group or cluste

AWS OpsWorks is a configuration management service that provides managed instances of Chef and Puppet. 
AWS OpsWorks for Chef Automate is a fully-managed configuration management service that hosts Chef Automate
OpsWorks for Chef Automate is completely compatible with tooling and cookbooks from the Chef community and automatically registers new nodes with your Chef server.
AWS OpsWorks Stacks lets you manage applications and servers on AWS and on-premises and uses Chef Solo.

Amazon ECS does not support IAM resource-based policies.
With IAM roles for Amazon ECS tasks, you can specify an IAM role that can be used by the containers in a task. 

Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a regular schedule

Configure the database security group to allow traffic only from the application security group. This setup will allow any instance that is launched and attached to this security group to connect to the database

A public subnet is a subnet that has an Internet Gateway attached and “Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address” enabled. 
Instances require a public IP or Elastic IP address. It is also necessary to have the subnet route table updated to point to the Internet Gateway and security groups 
and network ACLs must be configured to allow the SSH traffic on port 22.

A NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to access the Internet, it is not used for remote access
An IPSec VPN is not required to connect to an instance in a public subnet.

An Alias record can be used for resolving apex or naked domain names (e.g. example.com). 
You can create an A record that is an Alias that uses the customer’s website zone apex domain name and map it to the ELB DNS name
PTR records are reverse lookup records where you use the IP to find the DNS name.
The failover routing policy is used for active/passive configurations

Alias records are used to map resource record sets in your hosted zone to ELB, API Gateway custom regional APIs and edge-optimized APIs, CloudFront Distributions, AWS Elastic Beanstalk environments, Amazon S3 buckets 
, Amazon VPC interface endpoints, and to other records in the same Hosted Zone.


 A standard A record maps the DNS domain name to the IP address of a resource.
 You cannot obtain the IP of the ELB so you must use an Alias record which maps the DNS domain name of the customer’s website to the ELB DNS name (rather than its IP).
 

The key requirements here are that you need to temporarily deploy a large number of instances, can tolerate an delay (not time-critical), and need the most economical solution. In this case Spot instances are likely to be the most economical solution.

Amazon DynamoDB can throttle requests that exceed the provisioned throughput for a table. When a request is throttled it fails with an HTTP 400 code (Bad Request) and a ProvisionedThroughputExceeded exception (not a 503 or 200 status code).
 DynamoDB can automatically scale when using the new on-demand capacity mode
 
Access Logs on ELB are disabled by default. Information includes information about the clients (not included in CloudWatch metrics) such as the identity of the requester, IP, request type etc. Logs can be optionally stored and retained in S3

Amazon EMR is a web service that enables businesses, researchers, data analysts, and developers to easily and cost-effectively process vast amounts of data. EMR utilizes a hosted Hadoop framework running on Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3.
If the messages are over 256KB and therefore cannot be stored in SQS, you may want to consider using S3

 CloudFront  supports  https and geoblocking, which you can use to prevent requests from particular geographic locations from being served.
 
 Amazon Simple Workflow Service (SWF) is a web service that makes it easy to coordinate work across distributed application components. 
The Simple Workflow Service (SWF) is used for process automation.
 
 SNS supports notifications over multiple transports including HTTP/HTTPS, Email/Email-JSON, SQS and SMS.
 Amazon SNS supports Lambda functions as a target for messages sent to a topic.
You can invoke your AWS Lambda functions by publishing messages to Amazon SNS topics that have AWS Lambda functions subscribed to them
Because Amazon SNS supports message fan-out, publishing a single message can invoke different AWS Lambda functions 
 
 following are a few reasons why an instance might immediately terminate: 
 – You’ve reached your EBS volume limit.
– An EBS snapshot is corrupt.
– The root EBS volume is encrypted and you do not have permissions to access the KMS key for decryption.
– The instance store-backed AMI that you used to launch the instance is missing a required part (an image.part.xx file).

When you create a new subnet, it is automatically associated with the main route table. 
Therefore, the EC2 instance will not have a route to the Internet. The Architect should associate the new subnet with the custom route tabl

If you are installing MySQL on an EC2 instance you cannot enable read replicas or multi-AZ. Instead you would need to use Amazon RDS with a MySQL DB engine to use these features.

Without cross-zone load balancing enabled, the NLB will distribute traffic 50/50 between 
An NLB can load balance across multiple AZs just like the other ELB types.

You can manage a single connection for multiple VPCs or VPNs that are in the same Region by associating a Direct Connect gateway to a transit gateway

You can create a VPC peering connection between your own VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account. The VPCs can be in different regions (also known as an inter-region VPC peering connection).
The S3 managed keys will be AES-256

Within an IAM policy you can grant either programmatic access or AWS Management Console access to Amazon S3 resources.

Intelligent tiering moves data between tiers based on access patterns,

ELB nodes have public IPs and route traffic to the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances. You need one public subnet in each AZ where the ELB is defined and the private subnets are located.
AWS Global Accelerator uses static IP addresses as fixed entry points for your application. 
An Internet gateway (which is done at the VPC level, not the subnet level) or a NAT gateway will not assist as these are both used for outbound communications

Think of logical IDs as being used to reference resources within the template and Physical IDs being used to identify resources outside of AWS CloudFormation templates after they have been created.
If any health check returns an unhealthy status the instance will be terminated. For the “impaired” status, the ASG will wait a few minutes to see if the instance recovers before taking action. If the “impaired” status persists, termination occurs#
Auto Scaling will not launch a new instance immediately as it always terminates unhealthy instance before launching a replacement

Use On-Demand Instances  when to deploy several EC2 instances quickly to run the batch process and you must ensure that the job completes

When you're using an Edge device, the data migration process has the following stages:
1. You use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (AWS SCT) to extract the data locally and move it to an Edge device.
2. You ship the Edge device or devices back to AWS.
3. After AWS receives your shipment, the Edge device automatically loads its data into an Amazon S3 bucket.
4. AWS DMS takes the files and migrates the data to the target data store. 
If you are using change data capture (CDC), those updates are written to the Amazon S3 bucket and then applied to the target data store.

Pilot light most critical core elements are already configured and running in AWS (the pilot light).

SSD, General Purpose – gp2
– Volume size 1 GiB – 16 TiB.
– Max IOPS/volume 16,000.

SSD, Provisioned IOPS – i01
– Volume size 4 GiB – 16 TiB.
– Max IOPS/volume 64,000.

– HDD, Throughput Optimized – (st1)
– Volume size 500 GiB – 16 TiB.
Throughput measured in MB/s, and includes the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume.

HDD, Cold – (sc1)
– Volume size 500 GiB – 16 TiB
Lowest cost storage – cannot be a boot volume.

During failover RDS automatically updates configuration (including DNS endpoint) to use the second node.


A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and 
*** VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.
An Interface endpoint uses AWS PrivateLink and is an elastic network interface (ENI) with a private IP address that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service. 
Using PrivateLink you can connect your VPC to supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts (VPC endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services.

With a gateway endpoint you configure your route table to point to the endpoint. Amazon S3 and DynamoDB use gateway endpoints.

 EC2 instance can access the videos but direct access to the videos from other sources is prevented
 To allow read access to the S3 video assets from the public-facing web application, you can add a bucket policy that allows s3:GetObject permission with a condition, using the aws:referer key, that the get request must originate from specific webpage
 
 A CloudWatch Events rule can be used to set up automatic email notifications for Medium to High Severity findings to the email address of your choice. You simply create an Amazon SNS topic and then associate it with an Amazon CloudWatch events rule.
 
 When developing a custom identity broker you use the AWS STS service.
 Snapshots of Amazon EBS volumes are stored on S3 by design so you only need to take a snapshot and it will automatically be stored on Amazon S3.
 you can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (Amazon DLM) to automate the creation, retention, and deletion of snapshots.
 
 Amazon DynamoDB Streams captures a time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications in any DynamoDB table and stores this information in a log for up to 24 hours.
 
 When request submissions exceed the steady-state request rate and burst limits, API Gateway fails the limit-exceeding requests and returns 429 Too Many Requests error responses to the client.
 
 AWS recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to IAM. However, you can also use the IAM Query API to make direct calls to the IAM web service. An access key ID and secret access key must be used for authentication when using the Query API.
 
NAT Gateways are managed by AWS. 
NAT Gateways are used to provide Internet access for EC2 instances in private subnets
NAT Gateways are highly available in each AZ into which they are deployed. 
NAT Gateways are are not associated with any security groups and can scale automatically up to 45Gbps


NAT instances are managed by you. 
NAT instances must be scaled manually and do not provide HA. 
NAT Instances can be used as bastion hosts and can be assigned to security groups.

AWS Batch Multi-node parallel jobs enable you to run single jobs that span multiple Amazon EC2 instances. 
With AWS Batch multi-node parallel jobs, you can run large-scale, tightly coupled, high performance computing applications and distributed GPU model training without the need to launch, configure, and manage Amazon EC2 resources directly.

You can suspend and then resume one or more of the scaling processes for your Auto Scaling group
You can manually move an instance from an ASG and put it in the standby state.
Auto scaling does not perform health checks on instances in the standby stat#
You cannot disable the launch configuration and you can’t modify a launch configuration after you’ve created it.#

For Backup of DC, Implement an IPsec VPN connection and use the same BGP prefix 
Both Direct connect and IPSec VPN are active and being advertised  using BGP

Athena allows you to easily query encrypted data stored in Amazon S3 and write encrypted results back to your S3 bucket
AWS IAM policies can be used to grant IAM users’ with fine-grained control to Amazon S3 buckets

 Access Control Lists (ACLs) are legacy (but not deprecated), 
 bucket/IAM policies are recommended by AWS, and 
 ACLs give control over buckets AND objects, policies are only at the bucket level.
 
If you want to implement fine grained control over individual objects in your bucket use ACLs. If you want to implement global control, such as making an entire bucket public, use policies.

Auto Scaling can perform rebalancing when it finds that the number of instances across AZs is not balanced.
Auto Scaling rebalances by launching new EC2 instances in the AZs that have fewer instances first, only then will it start terminating instances in AZs that had more instances
Auto Scaling does not terminate the instance that has been running the longest.

Using Amazon Redshift Spectrum, you can efficiently query and retrieve structured and semistructured data from files in Amazon S3 without having to load the data into Amazon Redshift tables

To restrict web servers to be accessible only through the ELB you can configure the web tier security group to allow only traffic from the ELB. 
You would normally do this by adding the ELBs security group to the rule on the web tier security group

With EBS you can use KMS-managed or customer-managed encryption keys. With S3 you can use client-side or server-side encryption.
You backup EBS volumes by taking snapshots. This can be automated via the AWS CLI command “create-snapshot”. However the question is asking for a way to automate not just the creation of the snapshot but the retention and deletion too.

The EBS Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) can automate all of these actions for you and this can be performed centrally from within the management console

AWS customers are welcome to carry out security assessments or penetration tests against their AWS infrastructure without prior approval for some  services. (8)

With MySQL, authentication is handled by AWSAuthenticationPlugin—an AWS-provided plugin that works seamlessly with IAM to authenticate your IAM users

To enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VPC, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs.

An origin is the origin of the files that the CDN will distribute. Origins can be either an S3 bucket, an EC2 instance, and Elastic Load Balancer, or Route 53 – can also be external (non-AWS).
For RTMP CloudFront distributions files must be stored in an S3 bucket.


Amazon ElastiCache in-transit encryption is an optional feature that allows you to increase the security of your data at its most vulnerable points—when it is in transit from one location to another
using the Redis AUTH feature, the server can authenticate the clients.
"Redis AUTH command" is incorrect. This is used when using a password to access the database.


Trusted Advisor is an online resource to help you reduce cost, increase performance, and improve security by optimizing your AWS environment.
AWS Trusted Advisor offers a Service Limits check (in the Performance category) that displays your usage and limits for some aspects of some services

AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS. Systems Manager provides a unified user interface so you can view operational data from multiple AWS services 
and allows you to automate operational tasks across your AWS resources


- IAM Groups are collections of users and have policies attached to them.
- A group is not an identity and cannot be identified as a principal in an IAM policy.
- Use groups to assign permissions to users.
- IAM groups cannot be used to group EC2 instances.
- Only users and services can assume a role to take on permissions (not groups).

AWS CloudFormation provides two methods for updating stacks: 
direct update or creating and executing change sets. 

When you DIRECTLY UPDATE a stack, you submit changes and AWS CloudFormation immediately deploys them.Use direct updates when you want to quickly deploy your updates. 
With CHANGE SETS, you can preview the changes AWS CloudFormation will make to your stack, and then decide whether to apply those changes.

The Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) is not a serverless application stack, containers run on EC2 instances.
Direct Connect gateway provides a grouping of Virtual Private Gateways (VGWs) and Private Virtual Interfaces (VIFs) that belong to the same AWS account and 
enables you to interface with VPCs in any AWS Region (except AWS China Region).

You can access the instance metadata through a URI OR 
by using the Instance Metadata Query tool.
The instance metadata is available at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data.

 A VPC endpoint for Amazon API Gateway can be created and this will provide access to API Gateway using private IP addresses and avoids the internet completely.
A transit virtual interface is used to access Amazon VPC Transit Gateways
A hosted virtual interface is used to allow another account to access your Direct Connect link.


Elastic Beanstalk  is considered to be a Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution and allows full control of the underlying resources.
CloudFormation uses templates to provision infrastructure.

DynamoDB best practices include:
- Keep item sizes small.
- If you are storing serial data in DynamoDB that will require actions based on data/time use separate tables for days, weeks, months.
- Store more frequently and less frequently accessed data in separate tables.
- If possible compress larger attribute values.
- Store objects larger than 400KB in S3 and use pointers (S3 Object ID) in DynamoDB.


 An API cache is not enabled for a method, it is enabled for a stage.
 You cannot use Amazon ElastiCache to cache API requests.
 
 
 When an EBS volume is encrypted with a custom key you must share the custom key with the PROD account. 
 You also need to modify the permissions on the snapshot to share it with the PROD account. 
 The PROD account must copy the snapshot before they can then create volumes from the snapshot

Note that you cannot share encrypted volumes created using a default CMK key and 
you cannot change the CMK key that is used to encrypt a volume.
 CloudHSM is used for key management and storage but not distribution
