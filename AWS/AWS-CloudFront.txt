--------------------- Routing and Content Delivery -------------------------------------
CDN Content delivery network
distribute content to multiple edge locations around the world
200+ edge locations
High availability and performance
its a content distribution system (used to distribute contents to outside world)

Amazon CloudFront 
serve users from nearest edge loc based on user location
** Improved read performance, content is cached at the edge.
source content can  be S3,EC2, ELB and external websites
if no content found at edge, it will retriever from the origin server and cached at the edge location
can use multiple edge locations
provides features to protect your private content
integrates  AWS shield to protect DDos attacks
integrates  AWS WAF web app firewall to protect SQL Injection, cross site scripting

use cases
static/dynamic websites, audio/video and software downloads , HTTP and rtmp

cost benefits
0 cost of data transfer b/w S3 and CloudFront 
reduce compute workload for your EC2 instances

DNS domain name: which endures can access
Origin: where you get the content from S3,EC2
Cache Control : TTL = 24 hrs. default
configure HTTPS only (default support for both HTTP and HTTPS)
can redirect from HTTP to HTTPS
configure different cloud front behaviour for different URL path patterns from same origion
path pattern: *.php

Signed URLs used for
RTMP distribution (media streaming)
Application downloads (individual files)
situations where cookies are not supported

Singed cookies using key pairs
Multiple files (you have a subscriber website )
doesn't need any change in application URL

---------CLOUDFRONT ORIGINS------------------

1) S3 Bucket

Origin Access Identities (OAI)
** ensure only CloudFront can access S3, enhanced security
create a special CloudFront user
Create a bucket policy
allow access to S3 only to a special CloudFront user
CloudFtont can be used as ingress to upload files to S3
** Client - (passing header)--->  Edge Location --> Origin (S3 or HTTP) uses OAI

2) Custom Origin (HTTP)
ALB
EC2 instance
S3 Website 
Any HTTP back-end

** Client - (passing header)--->  Edge Location --> Origin (EC2 must be public) uses IAM Role
Security group of EC2 must allow all IPs of Edge locations

** Client - (passing header)--->  Edge Location --> Origin (ALB must be public) uses IAM Role  --> EC2 can be private
Security group of ALB must allow all IPs of Edge locations
Security group of EC2 must allow SG of ALB

CloudFront is a global service

Console -->CloudFront
Delivery Method --> Web 
OringDomain Name: select your bucket 
Default object: index.html
86400 secs = 24 hours
create distribution  (15 to 20 mins)

the contents will be automatically expire after TTL from the edge locations if not used
InvalidationAPI - to remove object from cache (from all edge locations) for emergencies 

use versioning in object path name

Don't use CloudFront for 
when all requests from a single location 
when all requests from corporate VPN

Scenario: Restrict content to users in certain countries
enable CloudFront Geo restriction
whitelist(allowed countries)
blacklist(blocked countries)


* CloudFront is great for static content that must be available everywhere
* S3 Cross Region replication is great for dynamic content that needs to be available at low latency in few regions

Practical
Create a bucket b1
upload some files

CloudFront -> Create Distribution -> 
Origin = b1
Restrict Bucket Access = Yes
Select Origin Access Identity 
Read Permission to bucket policy

A bucket policy automated created
make the files public
Open cloud front URl and append coffee.jpeg

so OAI is copied in the bucket policy to restrict it accessible only through cloud front


CloudFront Signed URL/Cookie
want to distribute paid shared content to premium user over the world
and see who has 
** access to individual files (one signed URL per file)
shared content (a few minutes)
private content (for years)

**Signed Cookie = access to multiple files (one signed cookie for many files)


Client -> Custom App -> AWS SDK to get Singed URL -> Edge location
Client -.> using singed URL -> CloudFront

CloudFront Signed URL
allows access to a path,  no matter the origin (s3,ec2,http)
can leverage caching features
account wide key-pair , only root can manage

S3 pre-signed URL
Issue a requet as the person who pre-signed the url
limited life time
use IAM key of the singing IAM principal


 -------------AWS Global Accelerator -----------------------------------
you have deployed an application and have global users to access
ie application in India region  with a public ALB but users are all over 
the world and their are hops when user connect via internet

Unicast IP
one server holds one IP

Anycast IP
All servers hold same IP and the client is routed to the nearest one.

AWS Global Accelerator uses Anycast
It leverage AWS internal network to route to your application
Anycast IP send traffic directly to Ede locations
Edge locations send the traffic to your application
2 Anycast IP are created for your application
works with Elastic IP, EC2, ALB,NLB, public or private
consistent performance
intelligent routing to lowest latency and fast regional failover
health checks and good for DR
only 2 external ip need to be whitelisted
DDos protection using AWS shield


CloudFront VS Global Accelerator

both uses AWS global network and its edge locations around the world
both services integrate with AWS shield for DDos protection

CloudFront
improves performance both cacheable contents images and videos and dynamic content

Global Accelerator
improves performance over TCP or UDP
good for non http use caes like gaming(UDP),IOT(MQTT) or voice over IP
good for http use caes that required static IP and fast regional faiolver

Practical 
** Accelerator is not Free

create EC2 in us-east-1
create EC2 in ap-south-1

aws global Accelerator
name: myFirstacc
Add Listener : 
port : 80
protocol : TCP
End point group
Region = us-east-1
Region = ap-south-1
with health check

Now click on Endpoint group : us-east-1
type: EC2
provide instance id
add end point  of EC2 in us-east-1


Now click on Endpoint group : ap-south-1
type: EC2
provide instance id
add end point  of EC2 in ap-south-1

Two static IP will be created by the Accelerator


**CloudFront Signed URL are commonly used to distribute paid content through dynamic CloudFront Signed URL generation. 
** S3 CRR allows you to replicate the data from one bucket in a region to another bucket in another region
** Global Accelerator will provide us with the two static IP, and the ALB will provide use with the HTTP routing rules
