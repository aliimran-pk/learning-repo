Disaster Recovery 
is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster

Kind of DR
on premise->  one data Center one city and other in others expensive
on premise -> AWS Cloud
AWS Cloud Region A -> AWS Cloud Region B

RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
is the maximum length of time after an outage that your company is willing to wait for the recovery process to finish
downtime

RPO Recovery point objective
is the maximum amount of data loss your company is willing to accept as measured in time

DR Strategies 

1) Pilot Light (for critical systems)
a small version of application is always running in cloud
ie RDS in data replication with on premise database is up
EC2 via Route53 is stopped

2) Warm Standby
Full system is up and running in Cloud but at minimize size
RDS in data replication with on premise database is up
ALB + ASG +  EC2 via Route53 (using reverse proxy) is running with lowest capacity
Upon disaster , we can scale to production load

3) Multi Site/ Hot Site Approach (v. expensive)
Full system is up and running in Cloud as of on premise
very load RTO 
RDS in data replication with on premise database is up
ALB + ASG +  EC2 via Route53 (using reverse proxy) is running with lowest capacity
Upon disaster , we can scale to production load

Backup and Restore has a potential High RPO and RTO

All AWS Multi Region
Aurora Global (master)  -> Aurora Global (slave)

DR Tips

1) Backups
EBS snapshots, RDS automated backups/snapshots

2) High Availability
use Route53 to migrate DNS over from region to region
RDS multi AZ , ElasticCache , EFS,S3

3) Replication
RDS replication (cross region), AWS Aurora + Gloal Databases
Database replication from on premise to RDS

4) Automation
CloudFormation / Elastic Beanstalk to re create a whole new environment

) Chaos
Netflix has "simian-army" , ie they randomly terminate their EC2 in production and check


----------- Database Migration Service ---DMS-------------------
* Migrate databases from on-premise to AWS
Resilient and self-healing  
*Source database remains available during migration
* Continuous data replication using CDC (Change data capture)
* Must create EC2 instance (running DMS) to pull data from on premise and load to the Target Database

On-premise -> AWS
AWS -> AWS
AWS -> On-premise
Homogenous (Oracle to Oracle) preferred 
Heterogeneous (Oracle to Aurora)
free for first 6 months when migrating to Aurora,redshift or DynamoDB

use case: 
consolidate multiple DB into a single target database
DMS is for smaller workloads (less than 10TB)
* continuous data replication for DR

Console -> DMS
instance Class:   ec2
multi Instance

Database Migration task
db source end point
db target end point

------AWS Schema Conversion Tool --------SCT-------
It is a part of DMS
preferred option for migrating data warehouse data to Redshift
Migrate DB schema if DB engines are different
OLTP(SQl Server -> Oracle) to Aurora
OLAP (Teradata or Oracle) --> Amazon Redshift

PostgresSQL on-premise -> RDS PostgresSQL
No need for SCT as database engines are same

SCT assessment report
update source code    
Fan-in (Multiple Source- Single Target) 
Fan-out (Single Source- Multiple Target)
SCT is preferred when schema conversion are involved
SCT is preferred for large data warehouse workloads (migration to Redshift)
No data replication for DR


1) On-Premise Strategy with AWS
Download Amazon inuz2 AMI as a VM

2) VM import / export
migrate existing applications into EC2
can export back VMs from EC2 to on-premise

3) AWS Application Discovery Service
gather info about your on-premise servers to plan a migration
server utilizations db dependency mappings

4) AWS Database Migration Service

5) AWS Server Migration Service (SMS)
increment replication of on-premise live servers to AWS
AWS Server Migration Service (SMS) is an agent less service which makes it easier and faster for you to migrate thousands of on-premises workloads to AWS

Transfer Large amount of data from On-Premise to AWS

200 TB of data , with 100 MBS internet speed

1)  Over the internet / site to site VPN
immediate to setup
185 days to complete

2) Over Direct Connect DX 1 Gbps
long time setup (over a month)
18.5 days 

3) Over snowball
will order 2-3 snowballs in parallel
takes a week to end to end transfer
can be combined with DMS

4) for on-going replication
site-to-site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync
