AWS Solution Architecture

1) Stateless Web App
http://whatisthetime.com
No DB
Scaling require

Starting simple

user -> EC2 t2.micro (with elastic IP)
Scale Vertical
stop instance , change type to large (downtime required)

Scale Horizontally

Route 53 (using Alias record) -> ELB + Health check -> EC2
Route 53 (using Alias record) -> ELB + Health check -> ASG(EC2)
Route 53 (using Alias record) -> ELB + Health check + MultiAZ -> ASG+MultiAZ (EC2)

2) Stateful Web App
myclothes.com
buy clothes online
shopping cart
hundreds of users at a time
not loose shoping cart
data in db


Introduce stickiness : Session Affinity 
using cart content in web cookies but make http request data heavier
also security risk if cookies can be altered
so cookies must be validated and must less than 4kb

Introduce Server Session
only session id is passed and get it from ElasticCache (alternative is DynamoDB)

ElasticCahe In Multi AZ
RDS in Multi AZ with Read Replicas

For security
https from cleint 
ELB : restric Traffic to EC2
ElastiCache: restrict trafic to ElaticCahce from EC2
RDS: restrict trafic to RDSrom EC2


3) Stateful web app , mywordpress.com
manage scalable wordpress website
access and display pictures upload
data in mysql globaly


Store Image
a. to EC2 instances
issue with reading as image is stored on only one instance

b. EC2-> ENI -> EFS

EBS is cheaper than EFS

4) Instantiating Applications quickly

1) For EC2 instances
Golden AMI , install apps , dependencies beforehand
2) bootstrap using user data for dynamic configurations
3) RDS:  restore from snapshot
4) EBS:  restore from snapshot

-----Elastic Beanstalk --------------------------------------------
Managed Service
simplest way to deploy and scale web apps in AWS
It is a developer centric view of deploying application on AWS
it uses all components like EC2,ASG,ELB,RDS etc
but still have full control over configuration

supports Java,.NET,NODE.JS,PHP,PYTHON,GO ,Rubbyand docker apps
Also custom platform
Its free but charges for resource being consumed

automatic LB
Auto scaling
platform update health monitoring

* Elastic Beanstalk is not EBS (Elastic bean store)

An application can have multiple environments to be created
An  application can have multiple versions (stored in S3)

Three architecture models
1) single instance deployment, good for dev
This will create one EC2 instance and one Elastic IP

2) LB + ASG for production and pre production web apps
3) ASG only , great for non web apps in production

Elastic Beanstalk has 3 components
1) Application
2) Application version 
3) Environment name 


Elastic Beanstalk

Name: My-First-ElasticBeanstalk-App
Platform: Python
Application Code: Sample application

It will create an Environment Tier

ASG created multiple AZ
EC2 created
ALB is created multiple AZ , created a Target Groups
two SG is created , EC2 and ALB


Web Server environment (for web apps)
Worker environment (for batch )

You can retain FULL control over ASWS resources created
It is ideal for simple web applications
Not ideal for Microservice architectures
access server logs without logging into the server
logs can be stored in S3 or in ClodwWatch
can configure SNS based on health
can apply patches and platform updates

Environment : MyFirstElasticbeanstalkApp-env
Application: My-First-ElasticBeanstalk-App
EC2 instance created : i-09198c2b1b80e3fcd
a LB is created (can make changes in ELB) : awseb-AWSEB-ZV73FYBTVZ9S

URL: http://myfirstelasticbeanstalkapp-env.eba-jsbz4ebm.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

To Delete
Delete the environment
Delete the application
it will delete EC2 and ELB 

EBS volumes are created for a specific AZ and can only be attached to one EC2 instance at a time. This will not help make our application stateles
EFS is a network file system (NFS) and allows to mount the same file system to 100s of EC2 instances. Publishing software updates their allow each EC2 instance to access them. 
Golden AMI are a standard in making sure you snapshot a state after an application installation so that future instances can boot up from that AMI quickly. 

--------------------------Event Processing in AWS------------------------------------------

SQS  + Lambda
in case of error msg goes to DLQ set by SQS

SNS + lambda
in case of error msg goes to DLQ set by Lambda

Fan Out Pattern (deliver to multiple SQS)

1) Application connect to multiple queues
Application -> SQS
not reliable
2) Application -> SNS - SQS

S3 Events

1) S3 event -> SNS - Multiple SQS (fan-out)
2) S3 event - SQS - lambda
good if lambda fails , then we can retry
3) S3 event (asynchronous) -> Lambda -> DLQ

if two writes are made to a single non versioned object at the same time,
it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent

** if you want to ensure that an event notification is sent for every
successful write, you can enable versioning on your bucket

------------------------------------Caching Strategies------------------------------------------------------------

Client -> CloudFront (caching with TTL, global service) -> API Gateway (caching, regional service) -> EC2/lambda -> Redis, memcached, DAX -> Database
Client -> CloudFront -> S3 for static files
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BlockIng an IP address

Client -> NACL (deny rule) -> VPC - SG( ALB)  -> SG(EC2)

we can use WAF with ALB or at CloudFront


-------------------High Performance Computing- HPC-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cloud is perfect place to perform HPC
you can create a v. high no. of resources in no time

services help to per HPC

1)Data Management and Transfer

AWS Direct Connect
Moves Gbs pf data to cloud, over a private secure network
establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.

Snowball and snow mobile
Moves PB of data to cloud

AWS DataSync
Move large amount of data between on-premise and S3, EFS,FSx for windows

2) Compute and Networking

EC2 instances
CUP optimized, GPU optimized
Spot instances/ spot fleets for cost saving + auto scaling

EC2 Placement Groups
cluster for good network performance 
low latency 10Gbps network
 
EC2 enhanced networking (SR-IOV)
higher bandwidth, highest PPP  (packet per second)
** Option1: ENA Elastic Network Adapter up to 100Gbps
** Option2: Intel 82599 VP up to 10Gbps, Legacy

Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA)
Improved ENA , only for linux
leverages MPA message passing interface
by pass OS to provide low latency and reliable trasfport

3) Storage

Instance attached storage
EBS: scale up to 64000 IOPS with io provisioned IOPS
Instance Storage : scale too millions of IOPS, linked to EC2

Network Storage
S3: large blob, not a file system
EFSL scale  IOPS based on total size
FScx for lustre: HPC optimized distributed file system, millions of IOPS, backed by S3

4) Automation and Orchestration

AWS Batch
supports multi-node parallel jobs which enables ou ti run single jobs that span multiple EC2 instances
easily schedule jobs

AWS parallel Cluster
open source cluster management tool to deploy HPC on AWS
configure with text files
automate creation of VPC, subnets


Creating a Highly available EC2 instance

1) User ->Elastic IP -> EC2 active - Monitor -Cloudwatch -> Lambda ->
start EC2 standby in case of failure and attach elastic IP to it

2) using ASG
User ->Elastic IP -> ASG -> EC2 

1 min
1 max
1 desired
>=2 AZ

EC2 instance role to Allow API calls to attach the Elastic IP

3) if EC2 having database with EBS and if EC2 down
using ASG terminate lifecycle hook create EBS snapshot + tag
now on ASG launch lifecycle hook EBS volume created and attach to it

High Availability for a Bastion Host
A bastion host is a server whose purpose is to provide access to a private network from 
an external network, such as the Internet. Because of its exposure to
potential attack, a bastion host must minimize the chances of penetration

Client 22 - VPC - Bastion Host (public subnet ) --> 22 EC2 (private subnet same or diff AZ)

 For HA 
 Add NLB (for port 22 )
 
 Client -> NLB - Bastion Host (public subnet) - EC2 (private subnet)
