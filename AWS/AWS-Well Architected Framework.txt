** AWS Well Architected Framework: 
https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/

---------Well Architect Framework ----------------------

5 PILARS
are synergy 


1) OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE PILAR
Includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business values and continually improve processes
To avoid/minimize effort and problems with
Provisioning servers
Deployment
Monitoring
Support

Design Principles of OpEx

1) perform operations as code
2) annotate documentation
3) make frequently small, reversible changes
4) refine operations procedure frequently
5) Anticipate failure

Recommendation
Use Managed Services (no worry about maintaining server,availability,durability)
Go serverless (prefer Lambda to EC2)
Automation with CloudFormation 
Implement CI/CD to find problems early (codepipeline, codebuild, codedeploy)
Perform frequent,small reversible changes

3 Stage approach AWS Recommend

a) PREPARE: for failure
simulate failure 
game days 
Disaster recovery exercise
Implement Standards with AWS config rules
AWS CloudFormation , AWS Config

b)OPERATE: gather data and metrics
AWS CloudFormation ,
Cloudwatch (logs agents)
config, config rules,
cloud trail
VPC flow logs
X-Rays (tracing)

c) EVLOVE: Get Intelligence
AWS CloudFormation , use Amazon Elasticsearch to analyse logs


2) SECURITY PILAR
IAM, AWS Shield, WAF,KMS, HSM

Security Design Principles

a. PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE for least time
Implement a strong Identity foundation
use temporary credentials when possible (IAM roles, Instance profiles)
use IAM groups to simplify IAM management
Enforce strong password policies
Enforce MFA
Rotate credentials regularly

Enable Traceability
Integrate logs and metrics with system to automatically respond and take action

b. SECURITY IN DEPTH - Apply security in all layers
VPS and Private subnets
Security Groups
NACL
use hardened EC2 AMIs (Golden Images)
use CloudFornt with AWS sheild for DDoS
use WAF with CloudFront and ALB
Use CloudFormation (enforce security via scripts)
Protect data in Transit and at rest
Actively monitor for security issues
Centralize security policies for multiple AWS accounts

c.Protecting DATA AT REST
enable versioning 
enable encryption KMS and Cloud HSM ,(rotate encryption keys)

S3
SSE-C,  SSE-S3,   SSE-KMS

DynamoDB
Encryption client, SSE-KMS

Redshift
KMS and AWS CloudHSM

EBS, SQS and SNS
KMS

RDS
KMS, TDE

d.Protecting DATA IN TRANSIT	
data coming in and out of AWS
by default All AWS API use https/ssl
perform client side encryption 
Ensure your data goes through AWS network as mush as possible
VPC endpoints and AWS Private link

e: Detect Threats
actively monitor security issues
Monitor CloudWatch logs
use GuadDurty to detect threats and contiguously monitor malicious behaviour 
use AWS Organization to centralize security policies 	


3) RELIABILITY PILAR
It is about how quickly you recover from Infrastructure and application issues/disruptions
How quickly you adopt changes demands in load
mitigate disruptions such as misconfiguration 

Design Principles

Test recovery procedures
use automation to simulate different failures
Automate recovery from failure
health checks and auto scaling
managed services like RDS  automatically switch to standby

Scale Horizontally
Maintain redundancy
multiple Direct Connect connections
Multiple regions and AZ
Prefer Serverless
prefer loosely couple architecture
SNS,SQS

Stop guessing capacity
use auto scaling

Distributed system best practices
API Gateway for throttling requests

Loosely coupled architecture
ELB
as users are not tied to EC2
SQS
SNS publish subscribe
Amazon Kinesis
handle event streams, multiple clients

Troubleshooting on AWS

S3 server access logs
S2 data request details,request type,date time
Troubleshoot bucket access issues and data requests

ELB Access Logs
Client IP,latencies and server response
analyse traffic pattern and troubleshoot network issues

AWS VPC Flow Logs
monitor network traffic
troubleshoot network connectivity and security logs

CloudWatch
monitor metrics from AWS resources

CloudWatch logs
logs from various , debug app issues

CloudConfig
AWS resource inventory, history , rules

AWS CloudTrail
History of AWS API calls , cli,sdk
auditing and troubleshooting, who did what and from hwere-

Shared Responsibility Model
Security and Compliance is shared responsibility b/w AWS and Customer

AWS responsible for  Security OF the cloud
Customer responsible for  Security IN the cloud


using EC2 instance is IAAS 
AWS only responsible for infrastructure only

Managed Services
S3,DynamoDB
AWS Manages Infa,OS and Platform

4) PERFORMANCE PILAR
meet needs with minimum resources (EFFiciency)
Use Managed services
Go Serverless (Lower cost)
Monitor performance
CloudWatch Alarms


EFFiciency use right solutions
Compute: EC2 VS Lambda VS Containers

Storage
Block, File , Objects 

Database
RDS VS DynamoDB VS Redshift (big data and relationsal)

Caching
ElastiCache (front end to DB) VS CloudFront (contents server from edge) VS DAX (cache infront of Dynamo DB) VS Read Replics (reporting apps to run) 

Network
CloudFront, Global Accelerator, Route 53, Placement Groups, VPS endpoints , Direct Connect

Product specific features
S3 Transfer acceleration , EBS optimised instances

5) COST OPTIMIZATION PILAR
match supply and demand
implement auto scaling stop dev and test resources when don't need
go serverless
Track you expenditure
cost explorer
aws budget 
use tags on resources, helps in measure ROI

Right Sizing
Trusted advisor for recommendations
On demand Vs Reserved VS spot instances
AVoid expensive sols: MySQL VS Autrora VS Oralce
AWS Direct Connect (save internet cost)
CloudFtont  reduce load on backbend system


X-Rays traces a request between API Gateway and Lambda functions

Well Architected Tool
AWS service used to lean,measure and build using architectural best practices
Define a workload
name: demo-workload
Industry type: education
Environment: Production
Region- us-east-1

Start Review  (answer questions)
1) priorities

-----------------------------------------AWS TRUSTED ADVISOR------------------------------------------------
High level AWS account assessment
Recommendations for cost optimization, performance, security and fault tolerance
All AWS customers get 4 checks free
** 1) service limits
2) SG\ having unrestricted access
3) Proper use of IAM
4) MFA on Root Account


Business or Enterprise AWS support plan provides over 50 checks
ie
how much u saved with reserved instances
resource utilization look like ? are u right sized  for ur load ?

RECOMMENDATIONS BY TRUST ADVISOR

Cost Optimization
highlight unused resources
opportunities to reduce costs

Security
Settings that make sol more secure

Fault tolerance
Increase resiliency 
redundancy improvements, over utilized resources

Performance
Improve speed and responsiveness

*** Service Limits
identify if service usage > 80% of service limits

Can disable Trusted Advisor using preferences
weekly email   notification preferences for Trusted advisor status








--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS SERVICE QUOTAS
AWS account has regional-specific default quotas or limits for each service
aService Quotas allows you to manage your quotas /limits for over 100 AWS services
from one location
