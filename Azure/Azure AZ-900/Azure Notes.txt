-----------------------------------------Describe Cloud Concepts (20-25%) ---------------------------------------------------
Benefits

1) Cost saving 
Total Cost of ownership TCO 

2) Agility
Ability to change rapidly based on changes to market or environment
launch new products faster
deploy resource ASAP
scale on demand

3) Availability
expressed as percentage , ability of a system to respond to the user
providing continuous services 
more regions
4 nines  99.99%
4 min per month downtime

4) Scalability
Ability of a system to handle growth of users or workloads
Vertical and Horizontal
 Scalability handles the increase and decrease of resources according to the system's workload demand
 Scale up means to increase the size of single machine
Scale-out – Upgrade the capacity of the app by increasing the number of host instances


5) Elasticity is the ability to Automatically or dynamically increase or decrease the resources as needed. 

6) Global reach
Azure 60 locations 
services deployed closer to the users
performance
cost
complacence

7) Disaster Recovery
Ability of a system to recover from failure within a period of time and how much data loss
setup easily


Capital Expenditure CapEx
upfront money invested in assets like computers that return investment overtime

Operational Expenditure OpEx
Money spend every day on operating expenses

Consumption Based Model
pay per minute
pay per per hour 
pay per per execution 


IaaS
virtual machine , networking , load balancer , firewalls

Shared Responsibility Model

IaaS = mean infrastructure is managed by cloud provider like hardware/hypervisor, physical host, physical network, physical data center
most basic cloud service
whole VM
example: 
Azure Virtual Machine, LB

PaaS =  infra+ OS +runtime managed by cloud provider
app and data managed by you
upload code packages and run them without access to the hardware
Example 
Azure WebApps

SaaS
pure consumption  model , directly consume the service
example:
box
google drive
Not running software on your own, you are just using product
Google Apps
Zoom


The Serverless Model
Less access to the server than PasS

with PaaS, scaling is your responsibility

Cloud Types

Public Cloud
Azure owns the hardware , on their network and infrastructure
rending the services

Private Cloud
Customer uses its own hardware
Azure Stack

Hybrid 
public and private 

-------------------------Core Azure Services ----15-20%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Azure Regions
60+ 
geographical locations

Region Pairs
Each region has one other region as its pair
always in the same geography
high speed
USA - East US - West US
Canada - Canada Central-Canada East

put backups in pair regions


Availability Zone
Region is divided in to AZ
AZ are isolated with their power, own network , cooling


Azure Subscription
is a billing unit (level of billing)

Resources
is an instance of services that you create 
eg when creating an instance of VM from Azure VM

Resource Groups  (folder type structure)
logical groups resources together
can be managed at resource group level
deleting a resource group will delete all the resources

resource group -> create new

Azure storage offers different access tiers: hot, cool and archive.
The archive access tier has the lowest storage cost. But it has higher data retrieval costs compared to the hot
and cool tiers. Data in the archive tier can take several hours to retrieve.
While a blob is in archive storage, the blob data is offline and can't be read, overwritten, or modified. To read or
download a blob in archive, you must first rehydrate it to an online tier.

Centralizing storage of application secrets in Azure Key Vault allows you to control their distribution


Authorization to access Azure resources can be provided by other identity providers by using federation. A
commonly used example of this is to federate your on-premises Active Directory environment with Azure AD
and use this federation for authentication and authorization.

third-party cloud services and on-premises Active Directory can be used to access Azure
resources. This is known as ‘federation.

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) is a centralized identity provider in the cloud. This is the primary built-in

You can configure a lock on a resource group to prevent the accidental deletion of the resource group. The
lock applies to everyone, including global administrators. If you want to delete the resource group, the lock
must be removed first.

In the portal, the locks are called Delete and Read-only respectively.
CanNotDelete means authorized users can still read and modify a resource, but they can't delete the
resource.
ReadOnly means authorized users can read a resource, but they can't delete or update the resource.
Applying this lock is similar to restricting all authorized users to the permissions granted by the Reader role.

account.


Azure AD Identity Protection includes two risk policies: sign-in risk policy and user risk policy. A sign-in risk
represents the probability that a given authentication request isn’t authorized by the identity owner.

Azure AD authenticates users and provides access tokens. An access token is a security token that is issued
by an authorization server. It contains information about the user and the app for which the token is intended,
which can be used to access Web APIs and other protected resources.
Apps can delegate that responsibility to a centralized identity provider.
